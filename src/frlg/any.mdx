This guide is an interactive version of [PulseEffect's Any% Squirtle route](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4fqPzBkLTsCEeLguL0I5xhiXimfVwhbLYwVpi4uRYA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Before Starting

- Make sure your save file options are:

  ![Options](../../static/img/frlg/Options.png)

- Mashing A, B, and L simultaneously is the fastest way to mash text.
- Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/IMdiOVMCIKY) on if you are a beginner to this speedrun or want to learn the newest methods in RNG Manipulation (this guide assumes the best stats).
- Download this [RNG Manipulation Program](https://www.speedrun.com/tools/Gen3Predictor1.2c.jar_2ssx4.zip) and set [these options](https://i.imgur.com/GB0YJig.png) if you are just starting out.
  Set [these options](https://i.imgur.com/lP39ReJ.png) instead once you learn the game well enough.
  - To help calculate offset for Flowtimer use [this website](https://plnkr.co/edit/w0hvCuTtvJVC6qRAZhGE?p=preview&preview) starting with Offset 0.
  - If you are on Nintendo DS change the line `$scope.fpses = [59.7275]` to `$scope.fpses = [59.7275, 59.5666]` in `app.js`.
- Pokemon LeafGreen has a version exclusive cut friend (<Pokemon name="Sandshrew" />) if you miss out on one in Route 1. Otherwise the version difference does not matter.
- The first 6 steps on normal grass, 7 steps in Viridian Forest, and 8 Steps in Mt.Moon are a 1% chance to get an encounter. This 1% 6/7/8 rule restarts after every brand new encounter.
- Recommend avoiding 28 Special Attack unless really good stats.

## New Game

- Choosing the boy or girl is preference.
- Give yourself a 1-character name ("A" is fastest).
- Give your rival a 1-character name ("A" is also the fastest).

## Pallet Town

- Check and insert your Trainer ID into the RNG Manipulation Program.
- Walk outside then head north towards the grass have Oak stop you.
- Mash through text until you can pick and manipulate Squirtle.
- Head down and fight your rival.
- Enter your Squirtle IVs:

  <StarterPicker />
  <br />

- ### Rival 1

  - <StateContext stateKey="starter">
      {({ nature, atk }) => (
        <>
          <Pokemon name="Bulbasaur" />:{' '}
          {nature === 'modest' || atk <= 3 ? (
            <>
              <PokeMove name="Tail Whip" /> x1, <PokeMove name="Tackle" />
            </>
          ) : (
            <PokeMove name="Tackle" />
          )}
          <SpeedInfo range={{ from: 0, to: 13, at: 0 }} />
        </>
      )}
    </StateContext>

    - Reset if Bulbasaur ever outspeeds you.

## Route 1-2

- Grab the <PokeItem name="Potion" /> from mart guy.
- Kill any level 2 or 3 <Pokemon name="Pidgey" /> / <Pokemon name="Rattata" /> along the way.
  - <StateContext stateKey="starter">
      {({ nature, atk }) =>
        (nature === 'modest' || atk < 21) && (
          <>
            <b>Do not</b> kill a level 3 <Pokemon name="Pidgey" />.
          </>
        )

            <Pokemon name="Rattata" /> on Route 1.
          </>
        )
      }
    </StateContext>
- Grab the <PokeItem name="Parcel" /> at the mart then head back to Oak’s lab.
- Catch <Pokemon name="Pidgey" /> / <Pokemon name="Rattata" /> if you come across them (Tackle once to weaken).
  - Do not try to force an encounter since there are backups later.
- On Route 2 cut through the grass before the Viridian Forest entrance (2nd tile to the right) it is 1% to get an encounter.

## Viridian Forest

- Avoid all non mandatory trainers.
- Grab the <PokeItem name="Antidote" /> near the sign above the 2nd Bug Catcher.
- Grab this hidden <PokeItem name="Potion" /> if necessary.

  ![Potion](../../static/img/frlg/ViridianPotion.png)

          the fight.
